        "description": "A Thousand Ships by Natalie Haynes is a 2019 novel that retells the Trojan War from the perspectives of the women involved, shifting focus from the male heroes to the goddesses, Trojan women, and Greek women who experienced the conflict and its aftermath. The book features numerous female narrators, including Cassandra, Clytemnestra, Penelope, and the goddesses, exploring themes of war, loss, and survival through their eyes. It's a feminist retelling that gives voice to those often sidelined in traditional accounts, like the captive Trojan women and the wives left behind."
